This is my invitation to join in the effort of making Kitty Klicker a reality for boys and girls accross the world to enjoy on their android devices, should you choose to accept

I'm interested in this project because it seems relatively simple but it has a lot of potential. using databases we can keep track of number of klicks and other things such as power ups etc. This could be really fun and interesting.

I'm interested in making the frontend as simple as possible so that we can focus on making the database as buttery smooth as we can. I'm also interested in thinking of new ideas on how we can use databases to make the Kitty Klicking experience as interesting as possible

Business:
  Free, but I agree ads would be cool if it makes sense.
  
Legal:
  Utah LLC I guess
  
Technical:
  Java and Android Studio sounds good to me!
