I would enjoy being a part of this team if you would have me. I really love the idea of making a clicker app with cats! It will be (hopefully) both adorable and addicting.

And it seems like a simple enough project that we would be able to complete it within the semester and not be too stressed out as long as we keep on track.

I believe I would be useful for coding either the frontend or the backend, with the systems you have decided to use.

Business
I like the idea that we won't charge people for it. It also makes sense that we could add ads in later, if we really needed to get money from it.

Legal
Utah LLC if it's necessary, I guess.

Technical
I think this plan is pretty good. All of the people in this class should have experience with the languages, programs, and databases you'll be using, because of CS240. I know I do!
