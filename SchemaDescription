Schema:

Users (UserID, Password, KittiesKlicked, KittiesPerKlick, TeamName)
Foreign key TeamName references Teams
Teams (TeamName, TotalKittiesKlicked)
Powerups(PowerupName, Requirements, Benefits, UserID)
Foreign key UserID references Users


Users
Users stores user information, including username, password, number of kittieklicks (score) they have, kitties they get per klick, and the name of the team they are on.
UserID = the unique user ID/ username that the user makes when starting, Password = password user uses for signing in, KittiesKlicked = represents the score of the user, KittiesPerKlick = the amount of points the user gets per klick (this amount can change over time), TeamName = the name of the team that the user is on (if any)
The users table rows each represent a user.
Powerups uses the userID to store powerup data for each user, and Users references the teams table with a teamID.


Teams
Teams stores the number of kittieklicks (score) there are for each team.
TeamName = the team name, required to be unique, TotalKittiesKlicked = number of kitties klicked collectively by the members of the team.
The teams table rows each represent a team.
This table stores the information for teams that users can be members of, and the users table references this table with the TeamName.

Powerups
Powerups stores the limited number of UNIQUE powerups available with the SINGLE user who has them.
PowerupName = unique powerup, Requirements = requirements to having/gaining the powerup, Benefits = the bonus(es) a user gets from having this powerup, UserID = user ID/ username to identify user who currently has that powerup
The powerups table rows each represent a powerup.
Users can have powerups, represented by the userID stored with each powerup.

Normalization:
These tables are:
1NF because:
- there are no lists in any of the tables
2NF because:
- All of the attributes in each table rely on the key for that table
3NF because:
- The attributes don't rely on anything but the keys
